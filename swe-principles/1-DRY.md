# Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)

"Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system"

**Core idea:**
- Make functions & classes so logic is only written in one place
- Linked with [SRP from the SOLID](SRP.md) principles

**Benefits:**
- Minimises redundancy
- Minimises chances of errors since changes only need to be made in one place
- Readability
- Consistency
- Testability

**Implementation:**
- Create functions/methods
- Use classes & inheritance
- Extract constants/configurations
- Modularisation
